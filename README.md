- Objective: Our platform is catered to users looking for a way to follow the
moods of celebrities. The objective is not only to find a place for sentiments of
the tweets of celebrities through predictive analysis but also to provide users
with constant updates on public sentiment and live tweets about that person.
In this way, researchers can identify patterns between public opinion of
celebrities and how they affect each others.
